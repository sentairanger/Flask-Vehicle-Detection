# Flask-Vehicle-Detection
This flask application uses OpenVINO for vehicle detection and recognition and the Pi Camera to take pictures of the vehicle.

## Getting started

To get started, first make sure to have a Camera module in hand. Any Camera Module can work, but a USB Webcam can be used if desired. An optional camera mount is also recommended, specifically one where you can take the Pi and the Camera Module with you. You can mount the Pi and the Camera Module in a professional tripod for example. You'll also need an Intel NCS2 which I bought from eBay. Next, you'll also need to install OpenVINO on your Pi. This has been tested on 64 bit Pi OS Bullseye but I will be testing on Bookworm and give any updates as time goes by. This application can be used by companies who want to inventory their vehicles, for example a Used Car dealer can keep an inventory of each car and categorize them using the images. To install OpenVINO follow this [guide](https://gist.github.com/sentairanger/caf11a2432ceebd715c6b33c224f4960). After installing and running tests, have the NCS2 inserted into a USB port on the Pi, have the Camera Module installed and be sure to have the mount all set up. This can be tested with an external HDMI monitor or using VNC. When using VNC be sure to enable VNC on Raspberry Pi OS. This project can run on Tablet or Smart Phone if using VNC. To run this, run `python3 app.py` on the terminal. Then go to `0.0.0.0:5000` on Chromium on the Pi and the app should appear. Press `Capture` to take a picture of the vehicle, then press `Detect` to detect and recognize the image. Then upload the newly created and press submit to display on the app. The image below shows a sample image.
